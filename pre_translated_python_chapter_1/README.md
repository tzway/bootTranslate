## What are those files?

These are the local storage from Tampermonkey, which contains translations of Boot.dev `Learn to Code in Python` Chapter 1 lessons.

## How to use those?

Pick your favourite language txt file, copy its content, paste the content into the `storage` tab of the script. You need to enable advanced settings in Tampermonkey in order to view or change the `storage`.
